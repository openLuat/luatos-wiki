> [Go to Taobao to buy](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=718378448520)

The IOT Power CC is a fully functional, stable and reliable small handheld high precision power meter that:

- Measure the voltage and current of low-power devices via USB C power supply
- Unlike other USB meters, measure the voltage and current at the output to better reflect the actual power consumption of the device
- Connect **PD fast charging** charger (support PPS) to induce the specified voltage and current output
- Voltage up to 24V, current up to 5A
- Current **multi-channel synchronous sampling**, no shift delay, the highest resolution of 0.15μA
- High accuracy and small error, details are available in [technical specifications](https://wiki.luatos.com/iotpower/cc/tech.html), verification is welcome
- Up to **10KHz sampling rate** to meet the power consumption testing needs of cellular modules, Bluetooth, WIFI, etc.
- Can **connect PC client** to view and analyze the current waveform, can also use the command line version on any device (win/linux/mac) to capture the serial data (such as Raspberry Pi), using the PC client to import to view
- **BOM cost open** (pull down below), conscience and sincerity of the work, sincere recruitment of suppliers with more favorable prices supply
- Shell information open, [open source shell address](https://cdn.openluat-luatcommunity.openluat.com/attachment/20230515082541036_%E5%A4%96%E5%A3%B3%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0.zip)

IOT Power CC is the ideal test tool for the majority of users to carry around.
